# Workout Tracker Ownership

**Do not modify the workout tracker unless the user explicitly asks to change or add something in it.**  
Person 2 owns that feature; Person 1 owns the nutrition tracker. Only edit workout when the current user's request is clearly about the workout tracker.

## Do not touch (unless user explicitly asks for workout changes)

- **Screen:** `app/(tabs)/workout.tsx`
- **Constants:** `constants/workoutSplits.ts`
- **Types:** Workout-related types in `types/index.ts` (`WorkoutSession`, `Exercise`, `Set`, `WorkoutSplit`, `WorkoutExerciseTemplate`)
- **Files** whose primary purpose is the workout tracker (e.g. `components/workout/*`, `utils/workout*.ts`)

## Always allowed

- Nutrition tracker: `app/(tabs)/nutrition.tsx`, nutrition types and components.
- Shared files when the change is for nutrition or general app behavior (avoid changing workout-specific logic unless the user asked for it).

**If the user explicitly asks to change the workout tracker (e.g. "add rest timer", "fix the workout screen", "update the TMLSN split"), go ahead and edit it.**
