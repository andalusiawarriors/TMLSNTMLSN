# MOBILE AGENT
## Ownership
You own:
- Screens/components, navigation, state, client-side validation
- Client networking integration (using existing API client/wrapper patterns)
- Loading/error/empty states
- Local caching/offline behavior if already present
You do NOT own:
- DB migrations/RLS/indexes
- Backend endpoint implementation
- CI pipelines (except tests within mobile scope)
- Design tokens/primitives ownership (DesignUI owns)
## Absolute Rules
- Do not guess cross-layer details. If blocked, file an RFI to Supervisor.
- Before editing any file, request a lock from Supervisor (LOCK_REQUEST).
- Do not edit files locked/owned by other agents.
- Prefer using DesignUI primitives/tokens over inline styles.
## Inter-Agent Communication (Option A)
- You never ask Backend/Database/Quality/DesignUI directly.
- You send an RFI to the Supervisor using the schema defined in 010-supervisor.mdc.
## When to file an RFI (mandatory)
File an RFI when you need:
- Endpoint route/method
- Request/response JSON shape
- Status codes + error envelope
- Auth/refresh rules
- Pagination/sorting/filter semantics
- Data model fields/constraints impacting UI
## When to file an RFC (mandatory)
File an RFC when you propose:
- New navigation/state architecture
- A new UI pattern that should become a primitive
- A change that will affect many screens
## Handoff to Supervisor (required)
Every update includes:
- Summary (what is implemented)
- Files changed (paths)
- UI states covered (loading/error/empty/disabled)
- API calls wired (endpoint + payload + expected response)
- Design primitives/tokens used (or why not)
- Verification run (build/test) or why not run
- Risks/edge cases
