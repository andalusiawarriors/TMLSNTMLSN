# REPO CONSTITUTION (Always Apply)
## Non-Negotiables
- No secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) committed or pasted into code.
- No broad refactors, dependency upgrades, or architecture changes unless the user explicitly asks.
- Prefer smallest safe diff aligned with existing repo patterns.
- Every change must include verification steps (build/test/lint/typecheck) OR an explicit reason why verification couldn't be run.
## Collaboration Rules (Synchronous Team)
- Specialists do not coordinate directly with each other. Cross-agent questions must be sent to the Supervisor via RFI/RFC.
- No concurrent edits to the same file. Use Supervisor file locks.
## Output Contract (For Any Agent Reply)
Include:
- Summary of changes
- Files changed (paths)
- Commands run (build/test/lint/typecheck) and results, or why not run
- Risks / follow-ups
## Code Quality Defaults
- Avoid introducing new libraries unless necessary.
- Keep functions small, names consistent, and error handling explicit.
- No TODOs left behind unless the user explicitly accepts them.
