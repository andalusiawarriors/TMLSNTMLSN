# Sync main project and worktree (obh)

This worktree and the main TMLSN project must stay the same and be updated the same way.

## Locations

- **Main project:** `~/Downloads/tmlsn-app 2` (or repo main working tree)
- **This worktree:** `obh` (current workspace)

## Rule

When you edit any of the following, **apply the same change in both places** so they stay identical:

- `app/(tabs)/nutrition.tsx`
- `components/BlurRollNumber.tsx`
- `utils/storage.ts`
- `utils/foodApi.ts`
- `utils/geminiApi.ts`
- `types/index.ts`
- `constants/theme.ts`
- `babel.config.js`
- `package.json` (dependency changes for this app)

After editing in the current workspace, copy the modified file(s) to the other location (main ↔ worktree), or remind the user to sync. Prefer: make the edit once in the active workspace, then copy to the other so both are updated.

## Why

Running the app from the main project uses main’s files; running from the worktree uses worktree’s files. If they differ, changes in one place won’t appear when running from the other. Keeping them in sync avoids that.
