# Nav / selection pill — transparent fill + 1px outline (outline colour = gradient)

Tab bar (navigation bar) and selection pill: **fill** stays transparent (Figma-style glass). **Outline** = a visible 1px stroke around the edge; the **outline’s colour** is a gradient or blend (not a flat colour). The gradient/blend applies to the outline only, not to the fill.

## Rules

- **Fill:** No fill at all times, no matter what is requested. Pills have **no fill** — transparent only (no solid fill, no gradient fill). Any depth tints (e.g. top/bottom) must stay at or below 10% opacity and are optional; base is always transparent.
- **Outline (stroke):** A **1px outline** around the pills. The **colour of that outline** must be a **gradient or blend** (not a flat single colour). Implemented as a gradient ring (full-size layer, fill inset 1px) so the 1px visible edge has a gradient colour.
- Layout, corner radius, animation, and structure must not change when touching these styles; only color/opacity values may be updated to stay within this rule.

## Where this applies

- **Layer 1:** Navigation bar background in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` (outline ring + inset fill).
- **Layer 2:** Sliding selection pill in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` (outline ring + inset fill).

## Allowed

- Transparent or very low-opacity fill (≤10% for any tint). Fill is not a gradient.
- 1px outline whose **colour** is a gradient/blend (so the outline is visible and not a flat colour).

## Not allowed

- Any fill on the pills (pills = no fill at all times).
- Gradient on the fill (gradient applies to the outline’s colour only).
- Flat single-colour outline (the outline’s colour must be a gradient/blend).
